- 👋 Hi, I’m @rjkcodesstuff
- 👀 I’m interested in Python, Linux, Bash scripting, front-end JS
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a bit of intermediate Python and tinkering with front-end JS
- 💞️ I’m *not* currently looking to collaborate on anything
- 😄 Pronouns: He, him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I spent the last 15+ years using Debina (or Debina derivatives) as my daily driver

I look forward to posting a bunch of personal hobby projects on this site. Maybe I'll contribute to something.
